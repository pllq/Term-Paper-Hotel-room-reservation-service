PL project is a Presentation layer. User interacts with it, input and ouputs values. 
	In my execution, PL can access only	PLInput [intermediate layer between PL (Presentation layer) 
	and BLL (Bistes Logic Layer)].

1. Menu.cs is called from Main(). In this class you can interact with menu, input values,
	which will be transfere to lower layers, and see output.

2. MenusToShow.cs contains methods, that return visual menu (Main menu, Hotel menu, Customer menu etc).
