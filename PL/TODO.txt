Tofix:

- in PLMethodsForHotel class -> AddHotel() method to block user possebillity to create same room numbers
- XMLSeriallization delets file if it exists.
- Serialization of Hotel works, but doest save to file anything
- in Hotel class for serialization has to be Rooms = info.GetRoom("Rooms") but NOT Rooms = info.GetString("Rooms");

ALL VARIABLES IN HOTEL class WERE PRIVATE!
